# balanceboard-visualizer

A demo written in godot to visualize the data received from my [balanceboard project](https://github.com/c0decaps/balanceboard). This will show a 3D model of an example balanceboard that mimics the movement of the real board that the sensor is attached to. 
While this in itself is only a simple demo, it shows that the measured data might be read and used within a game engine for example as a game controller.
